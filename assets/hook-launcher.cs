// caliber hook launcher — runs a hook without a console window while leaving
// its stdio alone.
//
// Why a binary at all, and why these exact flags (all measured, 2026-09-21,
// Windows 10 Pro interactive session and GitHub windows-latest):
//
//   * The console flash comes from console ALLOCATION, not from running node.
//     A parent with no console of its own forces a console-subsystem child to
//     allocate one, and that console is visible. Where the parent already owns
//     a console the child attaches to it and nothing appears.
//
//   * The previous approach, wscript + WScript.Shell.Run with SW_HIDE, hid the
//     window correctly (1 window at SW_SHOWNORMAL vs 0 at SW_HIDE) but handed
//     the child a FRESH CONSOLE instead of the parent's pipes. Claude Code
//     delivers the hook payload on stdin, and `learn observe` reads it through
//     readStdin() — which has a 5 s timeout and resolves EMPTY, so the command
//     hit `if (!raw.trim()) return;` and recorded nothing, five seconds at a
//     time. Measured 2026-09-21: pandorum eventCount 9, frozen since 18 May;
//     solidpc, same projects without WSH, 13728. The learning pipeline was
//     silently dead on Windows for four months, which is worse than a hang
//     because the hook still exits 0.
//
//   * CREATE_NO_WINDOW alone repeats that defect. It allocates a console, and
//     a child only takes its std handles from STARTUPINFO when
//     STARTF_USESTDHANDLES is set — which .NET's ProcessStartInfo sets only
//     when it is redirecting. So "don't redirect, and it will inherit" is
//     wrong, and fails identically.
//
// Both flags together are the fix: CREATE_NO_WINDOW so no console window is
// shown, STARTF_USESTDHANDLES with this process's own handles so the child
// gets the real pipes, and bInheritHandles so they survive the call.
//
// Built as /target:winexe (Windows subsystem) so the launcher itself never
// owns a console. Compiled on demand by src/utils/hook-command.ts using the
// csc.exe that ships with the .NET Framework on every Windows, so no binary
// is committed or published.
//
// Usage: hook-launcher.exe <exe> [args...]      exit code is the child's.
